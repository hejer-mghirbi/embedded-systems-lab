# Embedded Systems Lab

This repository documents my structured hands-on experiments in embedded systems.

As an Electrical Engineering student focused on IoT and Intelligent Embedded Systems, this lab serves as a practical environment to explore hardware–software interaction, low-level control, communication protocols, and real-time system behavior.
